# MSSQLDocker
In WSL Win Svr 2022

Here's a breakdown of how I got mssql working in a docker container in wsl on windows server 2022

First, install Win Server 2022

After run this script in powershell to install update the system and install hyper-v:
#Install.ps1

Once done, we need to install the distro wanted ( I used Ubuntu by default)
